Each folder within the SOC Pulse test folder contains the data from the SOC Pulse tests
which were run inside our incubator/fridge at that ambient temperature.
For example, the 20°C folder is the SOC Pulse test run on the battery while our incubator/fridge
kept the ambient temperature at around 20°C.
